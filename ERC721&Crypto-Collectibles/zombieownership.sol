/*A token on Ethereum is basically just a smart contract that follows some common rules â€”
 namely it implements a standard set of functions that all other token contracts share,
  such as transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) and balanceOf(address _owner).

Internally the smart contract usually has a mapping, mapping(address => uint256) balances,
 that keeps track of how much balance each address has*/

You, the owner, call approve and give it the _approved address of the new owner, and the _tokenId you want them to take.

The new owner calls transferFrom with the _tokenId. Next, the contract checks to make sure the new owner has been already approved,
and then transfers them the token.*/
